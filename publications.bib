The key steps are a photocatalytic hydroalkylation reaction, followed by an oxidative functionalisation to access               N               -protected {$\beta$}-amino acids, esters, and amides. This strategy can be effectively scaled up               via               continuous-flow technology.},

Herein, we introduce a deoxygenative cross-electrophile coupling technique that pairs easily accessible carboxylic acid-derived redox-active esters with aldehyde sulfonyl hydrazones, employing Eosin Y as an organophotocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This approach serves as a versatile, metal-free C(sp               3               )-C(sp               3               ) cross-coupling platform. We demonstrate its synthetic value as a safer, broadly applicable C1 homologation of carboxylic acids, offering an alternative to the traditional Arndt-Eistert reaction. Additionally, our method provides direct access to cyclic and acyclic {$\beta$}-arylethylamines using diverse aldehyde-derived sulfonyl hydrazones. Notably, the methodology proves to be compatible with the late-stage functionalization of peptides on solid-phase, streamlining the modification of intricate peptides without the need for exhaustive               de-novo               synthesis.},
