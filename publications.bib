A diverse set of highly functionalized heterocycles proved compatible with the methodology, and moderate to good yields were obtained within 30 minutes of residence time.},

  abstract = {This manuscript reviews for the first time developments at the interface between organic electrosynthesis and single-atom catalysis, highlighting advantages in shifting from a batch to a flow production.           ,                             The global warming crisis has sparked a series of environmentally cautious trends in chemistry, allowing us to rethink the way we conduct our synthesis, and to incorporate more earth-abundant materials in our catalyst design. ``Single-atom catalysis'' has recently appeared on the catalytic spectrum, and has truly merged the benefits that homogeneous and heterogeneous analogues have to offer. Further still, the possibility to activate these catalysts by means of a suitable electric potential could pave the way for a true integration of diverse synthetic methodologies and renewable electricity. Despite their esteemed benefits, single-atom electrocatalysts are still limited to the energy sector (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction,               etc.               ) and numerous examples in the literature still invoke the use of precious metals (Pd, Pt, Ir,               etc.               ). Additionally, batch electroreactors are employed, which limit the intensification of such processes. It is of paramount importance that the field continues to grow in a more sustainable direction, seeking new ventures into the space of organic electrosynthesis and flow electroreactor technologies. In this piece, we discuss some of the progress being made with earth abundant homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts and flow electrochemistry, within the context of organic electrosynthesis, and highlight the prospects of alternatively utilizing single-atom catalysts for such applications.},

The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate and washed five times with brine. The organic layer was dried over Na                     2                     SO                     4                     and filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the desired compound as a white solid (8.20\,g, 34.0\,mmol, 95\% yield).

Herein, we introduce a deoxygenative cross-electrophile coupling technique that pairs easily accessible carboxylic acid-derived redox-active esters with aldehyde sulfonyl hydrazones, employing Eosin Y as an organophotocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This approach serves as a versatile, metal-free C(sp               3               )-C(sp               3               ) cross-coupling platform. We demonstrate its synthetic value as a safer, broadly applicable C1 homologation of carboxylic acids, offering an alternative to the traditional Arndt-Eistert reaction. Additionally, our method provides direct access to cyclic and acyclic {$\beta$}-arylethylamines using diverse aldehyde-derived sulfonyl hydrazones. Notably, the methodology proves to be compatible with the late-stage functionalization of peptides on solid-phase, streamlining the modification of intricate peptides without the need for exhaustive               de-novo               synthesis.},

It comprises a relatively simple molecular structure. Rufinamide can be synthesized from an organohalide in three steps. Recently we have shown that microreactor flow networks have better sustainability profiles in terms of life-cycle assessment than the respective consecutive processing in a batch. The analysis was based on the results of a single step conversion from batch to continuous mode. An uninterrupted continuous process towards rufinamide was developed, starting from an alcohol precursor, which is converted to the corresponding chloride with hydrogen chloride gas. The chloride is then converted to the corresponding organoazide that yields the rufinamide precursor               via               cycloaddition to the greenest and cheapest dipolarophile available on the market. The current process demonstrates chemical and process-design intensification aspects encompassed by novel process windows. Single reaction steps are chemically intensified               via               a wide range of conditions available in a microreactor environment. Meanwhile, the connection of reaction steps and separations results in process-design intensification. With two in-line separations the process consists of five stages resulting in a total yield of 82\% and productivity of 9 g h               -1               (11.5 mol h               -1               L               -1               ). The process minimizes the isolation and handling of strong alkylating or energetic intermediates, while minimizing water and organic solvent consumption.},

Nevertheless, high pressure synthetic applications with subsequent benefits in the production of natural products are limited by the general availability of the equipment. In addition, the virtues and limitations of microflow equipment under standard conditions are well established. Herein, we apply novel-process-window (NPWs) principles, such as intensification of intrinsic kinetics of a reaction using high temperature, pressure, and concentration, on azide--alkyne cycloaddition towards synthesis of Rufinamide precursor. We applied three main activation methods (i.e., uncatalyzed batch, uncatalyzed flow, and catalyzed flow) on uncatalyzed and catalyzed azide--alkyne cycloaddition. We compare the performance of two reactors, a specialized autoclave batch reactor for high-pressure operation up to 1800\>bar and a capillary flow reactor (up to 400\>bar). A differentiated and comprehensive picture is given for the two reactors and the three methods of activation. Reaction speedup and consequent increases in space--time yields is achieved, while the process window for favorable operation to selectively produce Rufinamide precursor in good yields is widened. The best conditions thus determined are applied to several azide--alkyne cycloadditions to widen the scope of the presented methodology.},

The batch and flow protocol described herein can be applied to a diverse set of thiol substrates for the preparation of homo- and hetero-dimerized disulfides. Furthermore, biocompatible reaction conditions (i.e., room temperature, visible light, neutral buffer solution, and no additional base) have been developed, which permits the rapid and chemoselective modification of densely functionalized peptide substrates without recourse to complex purification steps.},

Indeed, a recent trend in photoredox catalysis is its application to the development of novel methodologies for amino acid modification. Herein, an up-to-date overview of photocatalytic methodologies for the modification of single amino acids, peptides, and proteins is provided. The advantages offered by photoredox catalysis and its suitability in the development of novel biocompatible methodologies are described.

A novel metric, defined as the `Average Photon Path Traveled in the Device' (APPTD), was introduced to measure the impact of different channel design choices and to rationalize the LSC-PM improvement over traditional LSC.

From the results, it can be explained that a narrow molecular weight distribution can be obtained due to the presence of a highly segregated flow behavior, even in microflow conditions, provided that the mean residence time is high enough. This paper investigates the feasibility of a living anionic polymerization reaction under micro-fluidic conditions. This is accomplished using a multiphysics model that accounts for the changes in viscosity and diffusivity. These properties descend with the increase in weight of the polymer, and could not be un-coupled from hydrodynamics and mass transfer. The results of the model are used to understand the reasons behind the very low PDI that can be experimentally obtained in microflow conditions. This leads to the conclusion that the increased viscosity almost ``suppresses'' the diffusion of the monomer, even at the very short characteristic lengths of a micro-device. These conditions generate a fully segregated flow that yields an almost monodisperse polymer regardless of the effective residence time distribution encountered in the reactor.                                                   magnified image},

Our method demonstrates good tolerance towards various functional groups, with electron-deficient nitroarenes being particularly suitable for this strategy. In addition, we have demonstrated the versatility of aryliminophosphoranes as intermediates in synthesizing anilines, amines, and amides. To further enhance the utility of our approach, we have developed a telescoped method that utilizes a tube-in-tube setup for the in-situ production of isocyanates.},

In order to more efficiently use the raw materials, and to decrease processing (and developing) time, it is necessary to consider novel synthesis routes and/or novel process technologies for biomass valorization. The use of micro-/millireactor technology for this purpose is still under investigation. This review introduces relevant processes for the conversion of biomolecules into the industrially valuable products developed (or under development) in a microreactor. The processes with the enzyme- and metal-based catalysts are considered and carbohydrates, amino acids, and their derivatives as starting materials for processing in microreactors are reviewed as well. Also, we discuss main motivations, achievements, and current challenges when using microreactor technology, and the status of a holistic process design approach in relevant fields. We suggest that although there are individual examples reported on sustainable process design including microreactor technology, the systematic approach is still missing.},

The method enables a fast, robust, and scalable methylation protocol that broadly accommodates various functional groups while preventing protodehalogenation. Mechanistic studies confirm the unprecedented generation of methyl radicals from an organo-aluminum precursor under photoredox conditions, bypassing the limitations of conventional two-electron pathways. This work expands the toolbox of practical radical precursors and provides a streamlined approach for selective C(sp               2               )-CH               3               bond formation.},

A conical Archimedean spiral facilitates exposure of the entire volume of the reaction solution to the irradiation beam. In this fashion, photo-high-p,T intensification of the photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol is achieved using either a pulsed ultraviolet (UV) laser excitation (in the order of femtoseconds) alone or in tandem with a conventional UV lamp. The goal is to control the kinetics of the side photoreactions under pulsed photolysis, as well as to reduce the reaction time and enhance the vitamin D               3               yield. Three kinds of effects are targeted: a) Utilizing a very large and spatially homogeneous photon flux inside the flowing solution; b) the novel process window of combining photo- with thermal intensification to promote the final, irreversible thermal step to vitamin D               3               ; and c) the use of sub-ps laser pulses to supply excitation energy on a timescale shorter than the formation of side photoproducts. Finally, photo-processing with the laser alone is compared to the tandem irradiation by the laser-UV lamp.},

The heterogeneous gCN photocatalyst, derived from earth-abundant precursors, facilitates the generation of acyl radicals under light irradiation, which undergo efficient nickel-catalysed cross-coupling to form a diverse array of ketone products. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and vinyl halides, and is compatible with a range of functional groups. Our studies revealed and addressed a competing Norrish Type II cleavage pathway, enabling the successful coupling of longer-chain substrates by switching to a 456 nm light source. Oxamic acids were shown to participate under similar conditions to furnish amides. Compared to iridium-based systems, this protocol significantly reduces total carbon release (TCR), and the gCN photocatalyst was readily recycled over 10 runs without loss of activity. This work highlights gCN's potential as a green, reusable alternative for metallaphotoredox cross-couplings.},

In this review, an up-to-date overview of both technological and chemical aspects of liquid phase oxidation chemistry in continuous-flow microreactors is given. A description of mass and heat transfer phenomena is provided and fundamental principles are deduced which can be used to make a judicious choice for a suitable reactor. In addition, the safety aspects of continuous-flow technology are discussed. Next, oxidation chemistry in flow is discussed, including the use of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and other oxidants in flow. Finally, the scale-up potential for continuous-flow reactors is described.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            C--H functionalization chemistry is one of the most vibrant research areas within synthetic organic chemistry. While most researchers focus on the development of small-scale batch-type transformations, more recently such transformations have been carried out in flow reactors to explore new chemical space, to boost reactivity or to enable scalability of this important reaction class. Herein, an up-to-date overview of C--H bond functionalization reactions carried out in continuous-flow microreactors is presented. A comprehensive overview of reactions which establish the formal conversion of a C--H bond into carbon--carbon or carbon--heteroatom bonds is provided; this includes metal-assisted C--H bond cleavages, hydrogen atom transfer reactions and C--H bond functionalizations which involve an S               E               -type process to aromatic or olefinic systems. Particular focus is devoted to showcase the advantages of flow processing to enhance C--H bond functionalization chemistry. Consequently, it is our hope that this review will serve as a guide to inspire researchers to push the boundaries of C--H functionalization chemistry using flow technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            To design an integrated continuous crystallization setup that is directly coupled to a photochemical synthesis in flow, the crystallization of vitamin D               3               was studied in~detail. Because of the high solubility of the vitamin in the reaction solvent               tert               -butylmethyl ether, a solvent swap to acetonitrile was necessary. While other methods use a multistep procedure, with the proposed approach, crystalline vitamin D               3               can be obtained within one crystallization step. The influence of crystallization parameters, such as the initial concentration of vitamin D               3               , stirring as well as cooling temperature, rate, and time, on the obtained results in terms of yield, crystal shape, polymorphism, and particle size distribution are discussed in detail.},

Part 1 of this review series discussed the potential of using short-time spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the mechanism and transition state of the Claisen rearrangement. Flow processing offers profound opportunities for studying these factors known to impact the Claisen rearrangement done in batch. It is shown that the same impact factors also rule flow processing, yet now superposed by the very different residence and reaction time settings and by novel process windows which go beyond conventional processing. As a result, massive intensification can be reached and a mechanistic analysis can be done in entirely unpaved processing fields. This links to the analysis given in part 1: it is likely that flow processing can further promote the understanding of the mechanism and transition state of the Claisen rearrangement and, thereby, promote the achievement of better reaction performance.},

This involves the use of high temperatures, high pressures, high concentrations (solvent-free), new chemical transformations, explosive conditions, and process simplification and integration to boost synthetic chemistry on both the laboratory and production scale. Such harsh reaction conditions can be safely reached in microstructured reactors due to their excellent transport intensification properties.

Moving these methodologies to continuous-flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (               f               -EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost-effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp               3               )-H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.},

This sustainable approach is compatible with a wide range of aldehydes and nitrogen-based nucleophiles, performing efficiently under batch conditions and demonstrating scalability with flow technology.

Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an               {$\alpha$}               ,               {$\beta$}               -unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale-up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha-containing peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.},

Here, the robustness of such a numbered-up capillary photomicroreactor system is tested when subjected to potential disturbances, such as channel blockage and light source failure. Channel blockage leads to relatively large changes in both flow distribution and yield. However, we found that the performance can be accurately predicted thus making it possible to adjust the reaction parameters to obtain certain output targets. Light source failure did not lead to large variations in the mass flow distribution, highlighting the importance of the flow distributor section. Since the reaction is photocatalyzed, the impact on the reaction yield was significant in the reactor where the light failure occurred.},

The implementation of continuous-flow reactors has resulted in rapid development of gas-handling technology because of several advantages such as increased interfacial area, improved mass- and heat transfer, and seamless scale-up. This technology enables shorter and more atom-economic synthesis routes for the production of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of literature from 2016 onwards in the development of gas-handling continuous-flow technology as well as the use of gases in functionalization of APIs.},

Laudadio               et al.               now report a convenient method to add ethane and propane directly across conjugated olefins with no prefunctionalization or byproducts (see the Perspective by Oksdath-Mansilla). The C--H bond scission in this hydroalkylation is accomplished by a decatungstate photocatalyst that also acts as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to complete the process. The reaction, optimized under flow conditions, works with methane as well, albeit with lower efficiency.

Because of the intrinsic inertness of these compounds, harsh reaction conditions are typically required to enable C(sp               3               )--H bond cleavage, barring potential applications in synthetic organic chemistry. Here, we report a general and mild strategy to activate C(sp               3               )--H bonds in methane, ethane, propane, and isobutane through hydrogen atom transfer using inexpensive decatungstate as photocatalyst at room temperature. The corresponding carbon-centered radicals can be effectively trapped by a variety of Michael acceptors, leading to the corresponding hydroalkylated adducts in good isolated yields and high selectivity (38 examples).},

However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross-coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single-electron-transfer (SET) and energy-transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C-X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C-C over C-O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.},

However, variations in solar irradiation conditions and the need for an external energy source to power electronic components limits the accessibility of this approach. In this work, a chemical solar-driven ``mini-plant'' centred around a scaled-up luminescent solar concentrator photomicroreactor (LSC-PM) was built. To account for the variations in solar irradiance at ground level and passing clouds, a responsive control system was designed that rapidly adapts the flow rate of the reagents to the light received by the reaction channels. Supplying the plant with solar panels, integrated into the module by placing it behind the LSC to utilize the transmitted fraction of the solar irradiation, allowed this setup to be self-sufficient and fully operational off-grid. Such a system can shine in isolated environments and in a distributed manufacturing world, allowing to decentralize the production of fine chemicals.},

Simply download the files and start printing!           ,              In both batch and continuous-flow reactor technology, reproducibility can be challenging for photochemical processes due to setup variability. One major contributor to this issue is the lack of standardized reactor solutions, particularly in academic laboratories where cost is often a prohibitive factor to purchase commercially-available reactor technology. However, advancements in 3D printing technologies and the availability of high-intensity light sources present an opportunity to develop cost-effective laboratory equipment. In this work, we present a diverse set of open-source reactor designs aimed at democratizing photochemistry while reducing the barrier of expensive technology. We introduce three new reactor designs: the UFO reactor for batch reactions, the Uflow reactor for seamless transition to flow processes, and the Fidget reactor for scale-up. After detailing the design principles and rationale behind these configurations, we characterize and evaluate their performance through simulations and experiments. These designs offer a standardized and affordable point of entry for researchers interested in exploring batch and flow photochemistry.},

However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is exceedingly rare due to the challenging C-H bond cleavage, which typically demands high temperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic molecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp               2               )-C(sp               3               ) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel-catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate-determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.},

The implementation of such processes is, however, hampered by their gaseous nature and low solubility, as well as the low reactivity of the C--H bonds. Efforts have been made to enable both polar and radical processes to activate these inert compounds. In addition, these methodologies also benefit significantly from the development of a suitable reactor technology that intensifies gas--liquid mass transfer. In this review, we critically highlight these developments, both from a conceptual and a practical point of view.

This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C-H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C-H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late-stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp               3               )-H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO).

As a result, an increasing number of organic chemists are exploring electrosynthesis. However, the efficacy of electrochemical transformations depends critically on the design of the electrochemical cell. Batch cells often suffer from limitations such as large inter-electrode distances and poor mass transfer, making flow cells a promising alternative. Implementing flow cells, however, requires a foundational understanding of microreactor technology. In this review, we briefly outline the applications of flow electrosynthesis before providing a comprehensive examination of existing flow reactor technologies. Our goal is to equip organic chemists with the insights needed to tailor their electrochemical flow cells to meet specific reactivity requirements effectively. We also highlight the application of reactor designs in scaling up electrochemical processes and integrating high-throughput experimentation and automation. These advancements not only enhance the potential of flow electrosynthesis for the synthetic community but also hold promise for both academia and industry.},

Mechanistic studies provided insight into the key role of benzophenone.           ,                             The efficient C-4 selective modification of pyridines is a major challenge for the synthetic community. Current strategies are plagued with at least one drawback regarding functional group-tolerant electronic activation of the heteroarene, mild generation of the required alkyl radicals, regioselectivity, safety and/or scalability. Herein, we describe a fast, safe and scalable flow process which allows preparation of said C-4 alkylated pyridines. The process involves a photochemical hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event to generate the carbon-centered radicals needed to alkylate the C-2 blocked pyridine. In a two-step streamlined flow process, this light-mediated alkylation step is combined with a nearly instantaneous inline removal of the blocking group. Notably, cheap benzophenone plays a dual role in the pyridine alkylation mechanism by activating the hydrocarbon feedstock reagents               via               a HAT mechanism, and by acting as a benign, terminal oxidant. The key role of benzophenone in the operative reaction mechanism has also been revealed through a combination of experimental and computational studies.},

Reflection, refraction and scattering extend the optical path length, enhancing photon absorption when bubbles are small.           ,              Light interacts with gas bubbles in various ways, potentially leading to photon losses in gas--liquid photochemical applications. Given that light is a valuable `reagent', understanding these losses is crucial for optimizing reactor efficiency. In this study, we address the challenge of quantifying these interactions by implementing a method that separately determines the photon flux and utilizes actinometric experiments to determine the effective optical path length, a key descriptor of photon absorption. The results reveal the unexpected impact of gas phase introduction in continuous-flow photoreactors. Notably, photon absorption, and consequently the throughput of a photoreactor, can be increased by the introduction of a gas phase. This enhancement arises from the reflection and refraction effects of gas bubbles, which can intensify light intensity in the liquid volume and thereby offset any loss in residence time. The photon absorption losses that were observed were associated with large bubbles and were less significant than anticipated. In contrast, the introduction of small bubbles was found to increase photon absorption, suggesting it is a potential strategy to optimize photoreactor performance.},

  abstract = {A modular, automated photoreactor system for CO               2               hydrogenation enables precise conversion into methane or carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide is subsequently utilized in carbonylation reactions, advancing sustainable synthesis and CO               2               utilization.                        ,                             Continuous-flow methodologies offer promising avenues for sustainable processing due to their precise process control, scalability, and efficient heat and mass transfer. The small dimensions of continuous-flow reactors render them highly suitable for light-assisted reactions, as can be encountered in carbon dioxide hydrogenations. In this study, we present a reactor system emphasizing reproducibility, modularity, and automation, facilitating streamlined screening of conditions and catalysts for these processes. The proposed commercially available photoreactor, in which carbon dioxide hydrogenation was conducted, features narrow channels with a high-surface area catalyst deposition. Meticulous control over temperature, light intensity, pressure, residence time, and reagent stoichiometry yielded the selective formation of carbon monoxide and methane using heterogeneous catalysts, including a novel variant of ruthenium nanoparticles on titania catalyst. All details on the automation are made available, enabling its use by researchers worldwide. Furthermore, we demonstrated the direct utilization of on-demand generated carbon monoxide in the production of fine chemicals               via               various carbonylative cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The urgent need to reduce the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere and keep the effects of climate change manageable has brought the concept of carbon capture and utilization to the forefront of scientific research. Amongst the promising pathways for this conversion, sunlight-powered photothermal processes, synergistically using both thermal and non-thermal effects of light, have gained significant attention. Research in this field focuses both on the development of catalysts and continuous-flow photoreactors, which offer significant advantages over batch reactors, particularly for scale-up. Here, we focus on sunlight-driven photothermal conversion of CO               2               to chemical feedstock CO and CH               4               as synthetic fuel. This review provides an overview of the recent progress in the development of photothermal catalysts and continuous-flow photoreactors and outlines the remaining challenges in these areas. Furthermore, it provides insight in additional components required to complete photothermal reaction systems for continuous production (e.\,g., solar concentrators, sensors and artificial light sources). In addition, our review emphasizes the necessity of integrated collaboration between different research areas, like chemistry, material science, chemical engineering, and optics, to establish optimized systems and reach the full potential of this technology.},

A variety of synthesis methods using microfluidics is presented for gold, silver, palladium, platinum, and copper nanoparticles, including the formation in single-phase flows and multiphase flows. In the field of organic chemistry, metal nanoparticles can be used as catalysts. This can lead to remarkably improved reaction performance in terms of minimizing the reaction time and higher yields. In this context, various applications of those metal nanoparticles as catalysts in microfluidic devices are highlighted at selected examples. As a new direction and operational window, nanocatalysts may be synthesized               in situ               in flow and directly utilized in an organic synthesis.

A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by increasing overall reaction yields and improving space-time yields compared with those of previously reported processes.           ,              Editor's summary                            There has been an extraordinary burst of recent research in photochemistry and photocatalysis  driven in part by the environmentally benign appeal of light as a source of reactivity. However, many of the studies showcase small-scale reactions, and scale-up relies on a patchwork of different technologies that can require substantial trial and error to optimize.

Yeston                        ,              A combined software and hardware platform facilitates substrate-specific optimization of photochemical reactions.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Photocatalysis exploits light for driving reactivity under mild conditions, contributing to advancements in synthetic methods for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Nonetheless, challenges persist in optimizing, replicating, and scaling these techniques. These challenges stem from practical considerations such as uneven light absorption and experimental variability, alongside chemical complexities such as poorly understood reaction mechanisms and intricate interactions among various variables. These phases in advancing photocatalytic processes are crucial yet time-consuming components of contemporary chemical manufacturing, requiring expertise and precision owing to their intricate and sensitive nature.                                         RATIONALE               In response to the need for efficient optimization of complex photocatalytic reaction conditions, we have developed a robotic platform named RoboChem. RoboChem facilitates the self-optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photocatalytic transformations. By integrating readily available hardware, customized software, and a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm, this platform offers a hands-free and safe solution, mitigating associated challenges. Operating autonomously, RoboChem eliminates the requirement for extensive expertise in photocatalysis or scaling processes to achieve optimal results. This renders RoboChem a valuable collaborative robotic platform suitable for any synthetic organic chemistry laboratory, irrespective of users' specific familiarity with photocatalysis.                                         RESULTS               The robotic platform incorporates several key components, including a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, cost-effective Internet of Things devices, and an in-line nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system. It uses a closed-loop BO approach to systematically explore a chosen parameter space encompassing both discrete and continuous variables. Consequently, the platform excels in identifying optimal reaction conditions that maximize either yield, throughput, or a combination thereof.               Operating within a continuous flow microreactor, the platform effectively addresses mass, heat, and photon transport considerations, resulting in the generation of well-structured datasets. These datasets capture both positive and negative results, thereby highlighting the influence of specific variables on the targeted objective function.               Furthermore, the optimal conditions identified by the platform have been successfully scaled up within the same continuous flow photoreactor. Manual isolation processes have been applied to obtain meaningful quantities of pure isolated compounds. Notably, the isolated yields closely align with the NMR yields obtained by the platform, validating its high precision and reliability.               The platform's capabilities were demonstrated across a diverse set of 19 molecules, covering various facets of photocatalysis, such as hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis, photoredox catalysis, and metallaphotocatalysis. Notably, human involvement was limited to the definition of the parametric space, the preparation of stock solutions and the isolation of pure compounds. The effectiveness of the platform stems from its BO algorithm, which efficiently captures intricate interdependencies among different reaction variables. Consequently, the platform consistently identified optimal reaction conditions that either matched or exceeded those obtained through manual approaches. As a result, the RoboChem platform stands out from conventional synthetic methods by tailoring reaction conditions to the specific needs of each substrate. This capability enables a thorough assessment of the applicability and limitations of the reported transformations, ultimately enhancing their value for potential industrial implementation.                                         CONCLUSION               The RoboChem robotic platform expedites and streamlines the optimization of photocatalytic transformations, simultaneously enhancing safety and liberating researchers to focus on other creative facets of chemistry.

This strategy offers a more environmentally friendly synthesis of trifluoromethyl(heteroatom)--containing molecules, with the potential for scalability in manufacturing processes facilitated by flow technology.                        ,              Editor's summary                            Broad classes of fluorocarbon compounds are provoking growing concerns over their combination of toxicity and environmental persistence. Fluorinated substituents nonetheless continue to play a critical role in pharmaceuticals. It is therefore increasingly important to incorporate these substituents with maximal efficiency and minimal residual fluorinated waste. Spennacchio               et al               . report a flow technique in which chlorocarbon precursors react rapidly with a simple cesium fluoride salt to generate CF               3               --N, CF               3               --S, and CF               3               --O motifs in complex molecules. ---Jake S.

Instead of the toxic and flammable carbon monoxide, this process utilizes carbon dioxide, thereby avoiding issues with bulk transportation of carbon monoxide as well as eliminating the need for safety precautions associated with the use of carbon monoxide. Obtained was a 77\% yield of the ester product at 180 {$^\circ$}C, 120 bar and with a 90 min residence time, which is over five times faster than for the same reaction performed under subcritical conditions in batch. An important factor for the performance of the system was to have a sufficiently polar supercritical mixture, allowing the catalyst to dissolve well. The optimal temperature for the reaction was 180 {$^\circ$}C, as the activity of the system dropped considerably at higher temperatures, most likely due to catalyst deactivation.},

These approaches are divided into six routes: the use of high temperatures, high pressures, and high concentrations (or solvent-free), new chemical transformations, explosive conditions, and process simplification and integration. Microstructured reactors, due to their inherent safety, short time-scales, and the high degree of process control, are the means that make such extreme chemistry possible.},

Mass transfer limitations were evaluated and an operational zone without mass transfer effects was chosen to study reaction kinetics.

The Hatta number further indicated elimination of mass transfer limitations. Reaction rate constants at different photocatalyst loadings and different photon flux were calculated.

On this basis, a mechanism was postulated for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation. The photon/energy efficiency of the photomicroreactor is described. By varying the power supply, the effect of the photon flux on the yield of the photocatalytic process could be demonstrated. The effective photoelectric transformation efficiency was rather low, which indicated that sufficient cooling is required to dissipate non-productive energy. Under optimal reaction conditions, the photonic efficiency substantially increased compared to batch reactors and other photomicroreactors. This could be attributed to the similar dimensions of the capillary photomicroreactor and the light-emitting diode light source, which minimizes energy losses due to unfocused light irradiation.},

However, one of the limitations of photocatalysis and photochemistry in general is the limited scalability due to the absorption of light (Lambert--Beer law). Here, we report the development of a convenient numbering-up strategy for the scale-up of gas--liquid photocatalytic reactions in which the gas is consumed. Only commercially available constituents were used and the system can be rapidly assembled by any practitioner of flow chemistry. The modular design allows us to systematically scale the photochemistry within 2               n               parallel reactors (herein,               n               = 0, 1, 2, 3). The flow distribution in the absence of reactions was excellent, showing a standard deviation less than 5\%. Next, we used the numbered-up photomicroreactor assembly to enable the scale-up of the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of thiols to disulfides. The flow distribution was again very good with a standard deviation lower than 10\%. The yield of the target disulfide in the numbered-up assemblies was comparable to the results obtained in a single device demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

The incubation time for the direct immobilization method was optimized for the highest amount of enzyme on the support. By introducing the immobilized TA in a packed-bed microreactor, a flow synthesis of phenylserine was developed, and the effects of temperature and residence time were studied in particular. Calculations of the Damk\"ohler number revealed that no mass transfer limitations are given in the micro-interstices of the packed bed. The yield does not exceed 40\% and can be rationalized by the natural equilibrium as well as product inhibition which was experimentally proven. The flow synthesis with the immobilized enzyme was compared with the corresponding transformation conducted with the free enzyme. The product yield was further improved by operating under slug flow conditions which is related to the very short residence time distribution. In all cases 20\% diastereomeric excess (de) and 99\% enantiomeric excess (ee) were observed. A continuous run of the reactant solution was carried out for 10 hours in order to check enzyme stability at higher temperature. Stable operation was achieved at 20 minute residence time. Finally, the productivity of the reactor was calculated, extrapolated to parallel run units, and compared with data collected previously.},

  abstract = {The rising popularity of bioconjugate therapeutics has led to growing interest in late-stage functionalization (LSF) of peptide scaffolds. {$\alpha$},{$\beta$}-Unsaturated amino acids like dehydroalanine (Dha) derivatives have emerged as particularly useful structures, as the electron-deficient olefin moiety can engage in late-stage functionalization reactions, like a Giese-type reaction. Cheap and widely available building blocks like organohalides can be converted into alkyl radicals by means of photoinduced silane-mediated halogen-atom transfer (XAT) to offer a mild and straightforward methodology of alkylation. In this research, we present a metal-free strategy for the photochemical alkylation of dehydroalanine derivatives. Upon abstraction of a hydride from tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMS) by an excited benzophenone derivative, the formed silane radical can undergo a XAT with an alkyl bromide to generate an alkyl radical. Consequently, the alkyl radical undergoes a Giese-type reaction with the Dha derivative, forming a new C(sp               3               )--C(sp               3               ) bond. The reaction can be performed in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and shows post-functionalization prospects through pathways involving classical peptide chemistry.},

The biobased semi-aromatic polyesters (e.g., poly(phloretic acid), poly(dihydroferulic acid), and poly(dihydro-sinapinic acid)), described in this paper, can be derived entirely from biomass (mainly lignin). The described polyesters exhibit thermal properties similar to those of certain commodity polymeric materials. These polyesters with ligno-phytochemicals as monomer have so far demonstrated complete and almost infinite molecular recyclability with a loss of total mass less than 5\% per cycle. Moreover, molecular weight and thermal properties (               T               g               ,               T               m               , and               T               cryst               ) of the tenth generation polymeric material are identical to those of the first generation.},

Scientists working in green and sustainable chemistry are increasingly committed to electrification and net-zero industrial practices. However, we must also ensure that these processes are resilient to disruption. In this article, we propose ten principles for more resilient chemistry, designed to add to the discussion and to stimulate further research into how chemistry can remain both sustainable and robust in the face of volatility in energy supply, resource constraints, and geopolitical instability. We call on the global chemical community to reflect on the implications of such disruptions---not only for industrial production, but also for scientific gatherings, laboratory research, and the future of chemistry education.},

Homogeneous catalysts are of great interest for synthesizing fine-chemical/specialty chemical/pharmaceutical products for their advantages of high activity and selectivity. However, their separation from the product remains a challenge. Transition metals and especially platinum group metals are used extensively as catalysts. They are expensive and there are strict regulations on the permitted levels of these metals in pharmaceutical products. Therefore, their effective separation is required. Moreover, we are running short of these and many other valuable metals. This puts more emphasis on the need to separate these homogeneous metal catalysts in their active form and recycle them back to the reactor. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of the current literature on the separation/recycling methods of homogeneous transition metal catalysts in continuous flow. These include heterogenization, scavenging, using biphasic systems and organic solvent nanofiltration. There are numerous successful demonstrations on the laboratory scale and recently also on the industrial scale.},

Here, we present a powerful approach for the light-mediated B-alkyl Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling between alkyl boranes and aryl bromides. Alkyl boranes were easily generated via hydroboration from readily available alkenes, exhibiting excellent regioselectivity and enabling the selective transfer of a diverse range of primary alkyl fragments onto the arene ring under photocatalytic conditions. This methodology eliminates the need for expensive catalytic systems and sensitive organometallic compounds, operating efficiently at room temperature within just 30\,min. We further demonstrate the translation of the present protocol to continuous-flow conditions, enhancing scalability, safety, and overall efficiency of the method. This versatile approach offers significant potential for accelerating drug discovery efforts by enabling the introduction of complex aliphatic fragments in a straightforward and reliable manner.},

A variety of strongly electron rich aryl chlorides, previously hardly reactive, could be efficiently coupled with aliphatic Grignard reagents at room temperature in high yields and within a few minutes' residence time, considerably enhancing the applicability of this iron-catalyzed reaction. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated on a multigram scale, thus providing the potential for future pharmaceutical application.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have been the object of numerous studies showcasing the potential of the homogeneous photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) for the functionalization of C(sp               3               )--H bonds. However, to translate these studies into large-scale industrial processes, careful considerations of catalyst loading, cost, and removal are required. This work presents organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) as an answer to reduce TBADT consumption, increase its turnover number and lower its concentration in the product solution, thus enabling large-scale photocatalytic HAT-based transformations. The operating parameters for a suitable membrane for TBADT recovery in acetonitrile were optimized. Continuous photocatalytic C(sp               3               )-H alkylation and amination reactions were carried out with in-line TBADT recovery via two OSN steps. Promisingly, the observed product yields for the reactions with in-line catalyst recycling are comparable to those of reactions performed with pristine TBADT, therefore highlighting that not only catalyst recovery ({$>$}99\%, TON\,{$>$}\,8400) is a possibility, but also that it does not happen at the expense of reaction performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Claisen rearrangement is an ideal candidate for mechanistic and transition-state analysis. Recently, physical-chemistry investigations, in particular relying on quantum mechanics and modern fs-pulse (`short-time') laser spectroscopy, have given totally new insights here. At the same time, flow chemistry has emerged, offering considerable processing advances over batch processing. It is also known to be much powerful with inline flow sensing techniques. Yet,  both key innovations have not been bridged so far and thus there is an eminent knowledge gap in mechanistic analysis of reactions. This two-review compilation is a first step to close this gap. Part 1 focuses on the insight which quantum-mechanical calculations can add to the existing knowledge based on heuristic, handy interpretation of reaction experiments in the light of electrodensity distributions. Quantum-mechanical calculation can provide geometric key data and short-time laser spectroscopy can verify this and deepen it in the sense of a comprehensive vibration analysis. In this way, prior structural assumptions can be confirmed or turned to be falsified and there is potential to resolve the uncertainty.},

Herein, we present an automatically responsive reaction control system enabling solar photochemistry under vastly changeable irradiance conditions. While the luminescent solar concentrator photomicroreactor (LSC-PM) design converts solar light into a narrow and steady spectral distribution, this reaction control system, inspired by the Quality by Design approach, maintains the reaction conversion constant at a set target value by dynamically changing the residence time in the reactor. The superior efficiency of an LSC-PM equipped with this reaction control system is shown both with artificially generated light fluctuations and in outdoor experiments using sunlight.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sunlight strikes our planet every day with more energy than we consume in an entire year. Therefore, many researchers have explored ways to efficiently harvest and use sunlight energy for the activation of organic molecules. However, implementation of this energy source in the large-scale production of fine chemicals has been mostly neglected. The use of solar energy for chemical transformations suffers from potential drawbacks including scattering, reflections, cloud shading and poor matches between the solar emission and absorption characteristics of the photochemical reaction. In this account, we provide an overview of our efforts to overcome these issues through the development of Luminescent Solar Concentrator-based PhotoMicroreactors (LSC-PM). Such reactors can efficiently convert solar energy with a broad spectral distribution to concentrated and wavelength-shifted irradiation which matches the absorption maximum of the photocatalyst. Hence, the use of these conceptually new photomicroreactors provides an increased solar light harvesting capacity, enabling efficient solar-powered photochemistry.
